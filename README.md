# <code-refactor>

## Description

- the purpose of this code was to improve accessibility and consolidate code
- I built this project to demonstrate my capability to clone and establish repo and identify css code that was repetitve
- overused messy code was eliminated and the repo was deployed
- throughout this project I gained a better understanding of git and css

## Usage
<br>
when opening deploying the github url it should appear like this (although ive set view to 50% to give a wider field of view)
